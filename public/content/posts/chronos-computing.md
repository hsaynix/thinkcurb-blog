# Chronos Computing: The Dimension of Time

In traditional engineering, data is a snapshot. In 2026, data is a river. At **ThinkCurb**, we are pioneering **Chronos Computing**—a methodology where AI agents don't just process what is happening *now*, but understand the weight of what happened *then*.

<br />

## Why Temporal Awareness Matters

Most AI models suffer from "Recency Bias." They over-prioritize the latest token. Chronos Computing introduces **Temporal Decay Functions**, allowing the system to "forget" irrelevant noise while "crystallizing" long-term trends.

<br />

### The Pillars of Time-Aware Systems:
1. **Temporal Context Windows:** Prioritizing information based on its "Age of Relevance."
2. **Predictive Latency:** Executing actions before the user intent is fully materialized based on historical patterns.
3. **Historical Weighting:** Giving more importance to events that have repeated over long cycles.

<br />

## Technical Implementation: The Decay Controller

To build a time-aware system, we implement a controller that calculates the "Value of Information" as it ages.

<br />

### Python Example: Temporal Information Decay Logic

```python
# ThinkCurb Pattern: Temporal Value Decay (TVD)

import time
import math

class ChronosController:
    def __init__(self, half_life_seconds=3600):
        self.half_life = half_life_seconds

    async def calculate_relevance(self, data_point):
        # Calculate how much time has passed since data creation
        age = time.time() - data_point.timestamp
        
        # Exponential decay formula: V = V0 * e^(-λt)
        decay_factor = math.exp(- (math.log(2) / self.half_life) * age)
        
        relevance_score = data_point.initial_value * decay_factor
        
        return {
            "data": data_point.content,
            "relevance": round(relevance_score, 4),
            "status": "ACTIVE" if relevance_score > 0.1 else "EXPIRED"
        }
