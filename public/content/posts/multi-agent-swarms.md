# Multi-Agent Swarms: The Power of Collective Intelligence

In the early days of AI, we relied on a single "Generalist" model to do everything. In 2026, at **ThinkCurb**, we have evolved. We no longer build single-agent systems; we build **Swarms**.

<br />

## What is an AI Swarm?

A Swarm is a collection of specialized agents—each with its own role, memory, and tools—that communicate to solve a high-level goal. Think of it as a software department where the Architect, the Coder, and the Tester are all AI agents collaborating in milliseconds.

<br />

### The Swarm Advantage:
1. **Parallel Execution:** Different agents handle different sub-tasks simultaneously.
2. **Error Correction:** A 'Critic' agent can review and correct the output of a 'Generator' agent.
3. **Specialization:** Instead of one model being "okay" at everything, you have ten agents that are "perfect" at one thing.

## Technical Implementation: The Swarm Dispatcher

Managing a swarm requires a central dispatcher that routes messages between agents based on their expertise.

### Python Example: Architecting a Collaborative Swarm

```python
# ThinkCurb Engineering: Multi-Agent Collaboration Pattern

class ThinkCurbSwarm:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            "architect": ArchitectAgent(),
            "developer": CoderAgent(),
            "qa_engineer": TesterAgent()
        }

    async def execute_project(self, requirement):
        # 1. Architect creates the blueprint
        blueprint = await self.agents["architect"].design(requirement)
        
        # 2. Developer writes code based on the blueprint
        code = await self.agents["developer"].write(blueprint)
        
        # 3. QA Engineer tests the code
        test_results = await self.agents["qa_engineer"].test(code)
        
        if not test_results.passed:
            # Feedback loop: Send errors back to the developer
            return await self.execute_project(test_results.feedback)

        return code
