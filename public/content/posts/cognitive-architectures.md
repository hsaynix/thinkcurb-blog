# Cognitive Architectures: Systems That Think

In 2026, the term "AI" is evolving. We are no longer just "prompting" models; we are building **Cognitive Architectures**. These are systems where the LLM is just one component of a much larger, stateful brain.

<br />

## The Blueprint of Digital Thought

A cognitive system at ThinkCurb isn't a single script—it's a symphony of memory, planning, and execution. We are moving from "stateless" chats to "stateful" entities that remember every interaction and learn from their mistakes.



<br />

## The Three Layers of Cognition

To build a system that truly "understands," we must implement three distinct layers:

<br />

### 1. The Perceptual Layer
This is how the system ingests data—whether it's through **Multi-modal** inputs (images, voice) or traditional text streams.

### 2. The Working Memory (Short-term)
This is the active context window. At ThinkCurb, we use **Dynamic Context Pruning** to ensure the model only sees what is relevant to the current task.

### 3. The Episodic Memory (Long-term)
Using high-dimensional **Vector Databases**, the system can recall past experiences from weeks or months ago to inform current decisions.

<br />

## Technical Implementation: The Memory Controller

Here is how we architect a memory controller that decides what to remember and what to forget.

<br />

### Python Example: Intelligent Memory Gating

```python
# ThinkCurb Pattern: Semantic Memory Gating

class MemoryController:
    def __init__(self, vector_db, importance_threshold=0.75):
        self.db = vector_db
        self.threshold = importance_threshold

    async def commit_to_long_term(self, thought_stream):
        # Analyze the 'Salience' or importance of the information
        salience_score = await self.analyze_salience(thought_stream)
        
        if salience_score >= self.threshold:
            # Only store high-value insights to prevent 'Vector Noise'
            await self.db.save(thought_stream)
            return "EPISODIC_STORAGE_COMPLETE"
            
        return "KEPT_IN_WORKING_MEMORY_ONLY"
