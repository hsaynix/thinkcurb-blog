# The Spatial Web: Beyond Flat Interfaces

For thirty years, we have viewed the internet through a 2D window. In 2026, that window is shattering. At **ThinkCurb**, we are architecting the **Spatial Web**—a digital environment where information exists in three dimensions, powered by AI reasoning.

<br />

## From Pages to Spaces

In the Spatial Web, we don't "visit websites"; we "enter environments." The role of the AI agent here is to act as a spatial coordinator, generating 3D layouts and assets in real-time based on the user's navigational intent.

<br />

### The Core Layers of Spatial UX:
1. **Depth Typography:** Text that isn't just on a screen, but positioned in a 3D coordinate system, scaling dynamically with user proximity.
2. **Semantic Environments:** Rooms and interfaces that reorganize their physical layout based on the task at hand.
3. **Neural Rendering:** Using AI to render complex 3D scenes with minimal latency.

<br />

## Technical Implementation: Spatial Dispatching

To build for the spatial web, we need a way to translate 2D intent into 3D coordinates.

<br />

### JavaScript Example: 3D Component Injection (Three.js + AI)

```javascript
// ThinkCurb Engineering: Spatial UI Coordinator

import * as THREE from 'three';

class SpatialNavigator {
    constructor(scene) {
        this.scene = scene;
    }

    async generateSpatialView(userIntent) {
        // AI analyzes the intent to decide the Z-index and Depth
        const layout = await ai.analyzeSpatialIntent(userIntent);
        
        const geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(layout.width, layout.height, 0.1);
        const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ color: 0x2563eb });
        const panel = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material);
        
        // Position the UI panel in 3D space
        panel.position.set(layout.x, layout.y, -2); // 2 meters depth
        this.scene.add(panel);
        
        return "SPATIAL_INTERFACE_RENDERED";
    }
}
