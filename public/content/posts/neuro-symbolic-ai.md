# Neuro-Symbolic AI: Logic Meets Intuition

For the past decade, AI has been dominated by "Deep Learning"—an intuitive but often hallucination-prone approach. In 2026, **ThinkCurb** is pioneering the shift toward **Neuro-Symbolic AI**, where we merge neural intuition with symbolic rigor.

<br />

## The Best of Both Worlds

Neural networks are great at pattern recognition (Intuition), but they struggle with basic math and rigid rules. Symbolic AI (Logic) is perfect at following rules but lacks flexibility. By combining them, we create a **Reasoning Engine** that is both creative and mathematically correct.

<br />

### The Neuro-Symbolic Stack:
1. **The Neural Perception:** Handles unstructured data like images, voice, and natural language.
2. **The Symbolic Solver:** Translates neural outputs into formal logic or code that can be verified.
3. **The Feedback Controller:** Uses logical errors to "re-train" the neural intuition in real-time.

<br />

## Technical Implementation: The Logic Bridge

In a Neuro-Symbolic system, the LLM generates a "Hypothesis," and a symbolic engine (like a Python interpreter or a Logic Solver) verifies it.

<br />

### Python Example: Integrating Neural Output with Symbolic Logic

```python
# ThinkCurb Engineering: Neuro-Symbolic Verification Loop

class NeuroSymbolicKernel:
    def __init__(self, neural_model, logic_engine):
        self.brain = neural_model
        self.logic = logic_engine

    async def solve_complex_problem(self, prompt):
        # 1. Neural Phase: Generate a potential solution (Intuition)
        raw_solution = await self.brain.predict(prompt)
        
        # 2. Symbolic Phase: Convert to formal logic and verify (Rigorous)
        is_valid, error = self.logic.verify_mathematically(raw_solution)
        
        if not is_valid:
            # 3. Refinement: Use the logical error to guide the neural model
            refined_solution = await self.brain.fix(raw_solution, error)
            return refined_solution
            
        return raw_solution
