# Generative UI: Beyond Static Components

For decades, we’ve built websites as fixed sets of components. In 2026, we are breaking that mold. At **ThinkCurb**, we are exploring **Generative UI**—interfaces that don't just respond to screen size, but to user intent.

<br />

## What is Generative UI?

Unlike traditional UI, where every button and card is pre-defined, Generative UI uses LLMs to stream functional React components directly into the application. The interface "morphs" to solve the user's specific problem in real-time.



<br />

## The Architecture of Intent-Driven Design

Building a Generative UI requires a tight coupling between the **Reasoning Kernel** and the **Component Library**.

<br />

### 1. The Component Registry
A collection of "Atomic" units (Buttons, Charts, Tables) that the AI knows how to compose.

### 2. The Streaming Protocol
Using technologies like **Server Actions** and **AI SDKs** to stream the UI state without a full page reload.

<br />

## Technical Implementation: Streaming Components

Here is a simplified pattern for how ThinkCurb handles component injection based on AI output.

<br />

### TypeScript Example: Dynamic Component Dispatcher

```typescript
// ThinkCurb Pattern: Generative UI Dispatcher

import { DynamicCard, DynamicChart, DynamicTable } from "@/components/ui/generative";

const UI_REGISTRY = {
  "FINANCIAL_DATA": DynamicChart,
  "USER_LIST": DynamicTable,
  "ACTION_ITEM": DynamicCard
};

export function UIDispatcher({ aiOutput }) {
  // Identify the required UI component from the AI's intent
  const Component = UI_REGISTRY[aiOutput.tool_call_name];

  if (!Component) return <DefaultView data={aiOutput.data} />;

  return (
    <div className="animate-in fade-in zoom-in duration-500">
       <Component {...aiOutput.props} />
    </div>
  );
}
