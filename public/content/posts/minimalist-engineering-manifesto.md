# The Minimalist Engineering Manifesto

In an era of infinite AI-generated code, the role of the engineer has shifted from "Creator" to "Curator." At **ThinkCurb**, we believe that complexity is a technical debt we can no longer afford. 2026 is the year of **Minimalist Engineering**.

<br />

## The Cost of Complexity

Every line of code is a liability. Every extra dependency is a security risk. A minimalist system isn't "simple"—it is "refined." It achieves the same outcome with 90% less overhead by utilizing native browser capabilities and advanced AI reasoning.

<br />

### Principles of Refined Engineering:
1. **Dependency Fasting:** Only add a library if it’s impossible to build the logic in-house.
2. **Native-First:** Leveraging the full power of the modern Web API and Rust-based edge runtimes.
3. **Intentional Friction:** Designing interfaces that don't overwhelm, but guide the user through purposeful silence.

<br />

## Technical Implementation: The Logic Pruner

To maintain a minimalist codebase, we implement "Pruning Agents" that scan our repositories for dead logic and redundant patterns.

<br />

### Python Example: Automatic Logic Pruning

```python
# ThinkCurb Pattern: Codebase Pruning Logic

class CodePruner:
    def __init__(self, repo_path):
        self.path = repo_path
        self.dead_weight_threshold = 0.5 # 50% unused functions

    async def scan_for_obsolescence(self):
        # Identify functions that haven't been called in 1000 hours
        obsolete_modules = await self.find_unused_logic()
        
        for module in obsolete_modules:
            print(f"PRUNING: Removing {module} to reduce cognitive load.")
            await self.archive_module(module)

    async def find_unused_logic(self):
        # Simulated logic for static analysis and trace-back
        return ["legacy_auth_v1", "unused_data_parser"]
